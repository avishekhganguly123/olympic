# Olympic_Data_Dashboard
This project dives deep into the world of the Olympics with an interactive dashboard.
We explore how countries perform, analyze athlete characteristics like age and gender, and track medal trends.
The dashboard uses eye-catching visuals to reveal fascinating insights, from which countries dominate to how medal counts vary across genders and age groups.
It's a powerful tool for understanding the many dimensions of the Olympic Games.
